# What is this respository for?

This repository is to supplement the Flask Workshop repository. Unlike the Flask Repository workshop, these files will have little to no comments.

Templates will be provided for the HTML templates, as the purpose is to practice the Python logic, rather than the HTML coding part.

## Instruction Set 1
Go into the `string-returning` directory and you'll find an `app.py` file. The file already has some code and comments in it such that you'll be programming the logic part.
