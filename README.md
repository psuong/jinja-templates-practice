# What is this respository for?

This repository is to supplement the Flask Workshop repository. Unlike the Flask Repository workshop, these files will have little to no comments.

Templates will be provided for the HTML templates, as the purpose is to practice the Python logic, rather than the HTML coding part.

## Instruction Set 1
Go into the `string-returning` directory and you'll find an `app.py` file. The file already has some code and comments in it such that you'll be programming the logic part.

The `string-returning` directory is associated with the `output-string` directory from the [Flask Workshop](https://github.com/psuong/FlaskWorkshop).

## Instruction Set 2
Go into the `templating` directory and see if you can fire up a webpage using the provided templates. The templates are barebones, but it's just for practice to see if you can figure out how to do variable assignment correctly in Jinja.

The `templating` directory is associated with the `jinja-templating` directory from the [Flask Workshop](https://github.com/psuong/FlaskWorkshop).

## Instruction Set 3
Try creating a new directory and fire up your own Flask Page using your own scripts rather than the one I provided. Include some CSS also; there are plenty of frameworks provided using CSS.
